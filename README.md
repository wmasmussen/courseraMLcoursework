# Coursera_Machine_Learning_Coursework

This repository will be the home for code developed as part of my machine learning coursework. This will be a starter repository for demoing results of the Coursework, and a point of reference for me to come back to as I do additional development in the ML space.

This coursework is done as part of the Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction.)

The coursework is divided into three main folders within the branch:

## course1/  - Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
Geared towards learning to:
- Build machine learning models using NumPy & scikit-learn
- Build & train supervised machine learning models for prediction & binary classification tasks, including linear regression & logistic regression

## course2/  - Advanced Learning Algorithms
Geared towards learning to:
- Build & train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification
- Apply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world
- Build & use decision trees & tree ensemble methods, including random forest & boosted trees

## course3/  - Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning
Geared towards learning to:
- Use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning: including clustering & anomaly detection
- Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach & a content-based deep learning method
- Build a deep reinforcement learning model
